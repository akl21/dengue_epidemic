# dengue_epidemic
In this repo I present my analysis of data on a historical dengue outbreak in a Mexican city. My goal is to determine which variables were related to disease occurence. The data set consists of records on 196 people from two sectors of the city, and the variables include the person's identification number, age, socioeconomic status, the city sector, savings account status, and disease status. The socioeconomic status is a categorical variable with 1 representing the upper status, 2 representing a middle status, and 3 representing a lower status. The savings account status is also categorical, where if the person had a savings account, this variable was entered as a 1, and as a 0 if not. The sector variable was categorical, with 1 indicating that the person lived in sector 1 of the city, and 2 showing that the person lived in sector 2 of the city. The disease status was coded as a 1 if the person had the disease, and a 0 otherwise. Finally, age is recorded in years.
